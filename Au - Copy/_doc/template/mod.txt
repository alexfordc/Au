Using the "mathew" template. It is included in the DocFX "Templates" webpage. Downloaded from github.
To install it: copy its "src" folder to our doc folder and rename to "template". In docfx.json: "template": [ "default","template" ].

Note: after copy/paste in VS, undo autoformatting done by VS. It damages <pre>.
______________________________

File class.header.tmpl.partial:

The template has bugs and removed/reordered/damaged parts. I replaced it with the default template text, exported with RunConsole2(F"{docfx} template export default").
Modified: moved the inheritance etc part to the bottom. Syntax too. Reordered. Removed implements.

Also added <br/> in class.header.tmpl.partial and class.tmpl.partial.
______________________________

File logo.tmpl.partial:

Deleted all text to remove the default D logo.
