# Au automation library and editor

#### Library
Au library contains functions to automate various tasks on Windows computers.

Some features: Send keys and text to windows. Find and click buttons, links, images and other UI objects. Launch programs and auto-close windows. Process text and other data. Auto-replace text when typing. Hotkeys and other triggers.

Written mostly in C#, it is a .NET library.

Free, open-source, MIT license.

#### Editor
Au editor program is an integrated scripting environment for creating and executing automation scripts that use the Au automation library which is installed together.

The programming language for writing scripts is C#. To use the library with VB.NET and other .NET languages you need Visual Studio.

Can be used to create C# scripts, programs (.exe) and libraries (.dll) for any purpose, with or without the Au library. Like a mini Visual Studio.

Free, open-source.

#### Where can run
Editor and library can run on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10. Currently editor is 64-bit only.

Also need .NET Core 3.0 or later. It is a collection of libraries from Microsoft. Install both Core Runtime x64 and Core Desktop Runtime x64. The download and setup is fast and easy.

#### Unfinished
Currently both editor and library are unfinished. The most important parts are finished and can be used, but some classes and functions can be changed in the future, which can break your scripts, clear settings, etc.

Currently the editor program does not have a real name and can be called "Au editor" or "QM3" (version 3 of Quick Macros).
