# Au automation library and editor

Au library contains functions to automate various tasks on Windows. User interface automation, web page automation, launching programs, text processing, hotkeys, autotext, auto-close windows, etc.

Au editor is an integrated scripting environment (ISE) for creating and executing automation scripts using the Au automation library which is installed together.

Both library and editor are free and open-source.

The programming language is C#. Both library and editor use .NET Core 3.0 or later.

Au editor can be used to create C# programs and libraries for any purpose. Like a mini Visual Studio. You can use the Au library or not.

Au library is a .NET library and can be used in any program that uses .NET Core 3. Can be used with Visual Studio, which supports more programming languages, debugging, etc.

Both editor and library can run on Windows 7 and later. Also must be installed .NET Core 3.0 or later (Core Runtime x64 and Core Desktop Runtime x64). Editor can run only on 64-bit Windows (32-bit is almost extinct), but can create 32-bit .exe and .dll files.

Currently both editor and library are unfinished. Can be used, but many things later can be changed, which can break your scripts, clear settings, etc. Currently the editor program does not have a real name and can be called "Au editor" or "QM3" (version 3 of Quick Macros).
