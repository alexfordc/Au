The Libraries folder is for third-party assemblies that can be used in scripts as references specified like //\\r FileName.dll.
Scripts also can use assemblies from the main Au folder.
When a reference is specified without .dll (like //\\r FileName), it must be in the .NET framework runtime folder or in GAC.
Also references can be specified using full path or path relative to the main Au folder, but may be problems locating them at run time.
