//Classes and functions that were (almost) finished, but rejected for some reason. Maybe still can be useful in the future.
//For example, when tried to make faster/better than existing .NET classes/functions, but the result was not fast/good enough.
//Older code moved to QM2 macro "Catkeys old rejected code".
