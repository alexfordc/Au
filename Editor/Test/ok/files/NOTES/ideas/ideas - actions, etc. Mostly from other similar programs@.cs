Find image near mouse or certain coordinate (instead of RECT).

Wait for certain/changed text in clipboard.

Wait for file exist/notexist, locked/nonlocked.

Wait for a voice command.

Wait for started process.

Wait for file exists or notlocked.

Html dialog.

SendKeysToWindow.

If cursor (without waiting).

Easier 'if OS version' (examples, link to API).

Easier 'if program running/active'. Now even difficult to find ProcessNameToId.

Easier 'if registry key/value exists/writable'.

Easier 'if variable =, compare string, etc'.

Reset hooks. Because now QM does not auto-reset. Could be shutdown -8.
