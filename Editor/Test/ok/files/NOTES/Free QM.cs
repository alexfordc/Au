Make it separate app, with some limited features:

1. Unavailable in USA, EU etc. Or available at half of price of full QM.

2. For non-commercial use only. Eg does not work if a network or domain detected.

3. No Help file. On F1 etc go to online Help. Use Google ads there.

4. Remove most tool dialogs, except finders (win, acc, htm, scan). In full version add many tools, also to edit existing code (unavailable in free version).

5. Donations.
	Add "Donate" link in forum signature.

6. Paid support.

7. Don't make free automatically.
	Let at first be in evaluation period.
	When QM starts, display in output: "Possibly QM is free in your country. <link>Detect country and get free regcode</link>."
	When clicks the link, connects to quickmacros.com. It detects country, generates free regcode, and QM displays it in output.
	In PHP get country from online IP-to-country database or/and service.
	The regcode is valid for 1 year. Like Avast etc.

8. The full QM edition could be at half of price in developing countries.

9. The free regcode should be tied to hardware, to prevent cheating: somebody from a rich country asks his friend from a LD country to register for him. Use type/id/serial of HD (GetVolumeInformation), MAC (GetAdaptersInfo), CPU (__cpuid), MB/BIOS (GetSystemFirmwareTable), PC (GetComputerName), and ask to reregister if more than 1 of them changed.

10. Can make exe, but let it work only on max 2 specified computers.

11. Can use toolbars, but only 2 free and 5 window-attached.

12. No features that need to change IL, use service etc. Like in portable QM.

__________________________________________

or

1. It is like the portable QM version, ie more lightweight. It means cannot change IL, use service, scheduler, etc. All other features available.

2. Free in developing countries. In other countries at half of price of full QM.

5, 6, 7. Like above.
