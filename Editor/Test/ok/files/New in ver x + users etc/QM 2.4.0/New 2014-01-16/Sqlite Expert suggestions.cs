BLOB columns in a grid view: sort when user clicks column header. Now I use a workaround with a VIEW that adds a hex column.
BLOB (or BLOB_TEXT) in a grid view: show as text or hex (how user wants), until certain size. Null, non-ASCII and control characters should be displayed as dots, and not terminate the string.
Hex editor: allow to add and delete bytes. Now can only change existing bytes, and displays changed bytes white, almost invisible.
INT in a grid view: option to display hex, like 0x01ff.
Add FILETIME to available types, as Windows FILETIME format, possibly big endian. Display as date/time string.
Option: when closing a database, don't remove it from the list.
