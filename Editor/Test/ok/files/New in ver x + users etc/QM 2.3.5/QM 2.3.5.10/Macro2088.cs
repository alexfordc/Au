Make shareware program free in some countries

**Idea.** To make my shareware program free in less-developed countries. Or release a free edition for these countries.

**Purpose.** More users, bug reports, extensions, active forum, etc. Anyway, 90% sales are in ~30 richest countries. Why not make it free in China, India, Russia...

**Question.** Do you think it is a good idea? What are possible problems? I can't find info on this topic. It seems that almost nobody does it (I know only Windows 7 Home Basic).

**Algorithm.** How would you implement it? I know it's possible to detect country using IP. It's OK if would fail to detect in 20% cases. When country is detected, the user would get license key for free. Country detection and license key generation can be implemented in web server.
