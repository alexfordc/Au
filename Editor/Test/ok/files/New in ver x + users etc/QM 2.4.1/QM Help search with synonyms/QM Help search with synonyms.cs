Tried to implement synonyms, but unsuccessfully.
The biggest problem - did not find a good computer-specific synonyms thesaurus.
All tested are not computer-specific. Too many synonyms that have no sense.
Failed to filter automatically. Too much work to filter manually.
From tested ones, the best was WordWeb. It is a software program. With QM can automate to extract everything you need. The words list is similar to wordnik.com.
Others probably created from 100-year old thesaurus books, eg don't have synonyms directory=folder etc.
