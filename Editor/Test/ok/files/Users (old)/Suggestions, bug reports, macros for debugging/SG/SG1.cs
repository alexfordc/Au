Managing Sets of Macros

A set being a collection of macros made for a certain task or program.

Thoughts for the present:

a) Disable (all macros in) a folder

Ive needed this for a long time, in QM1.3.3, and now too. Currently i execute a macro that has "dis" commands listing each macro i want disabled. Adding "Disable" in the context menu of folders would greatly simplify things. Then i can create macros for specific tasks and quickly disable the whole lot when i want to switch to a different task that uses the same keys differently. As i create new macros for a task, it would go its folder and becomes part of a set that can be disabled/enabled, rather than just individually. Nested folders? Hmmm, maybe have it work like NTFS permissions in Windows NT or 2000; ie options to affect all subfolders or not.

Sure i can accomplish this by loading different files, or by exporting&deleting what i want disabled, followed by importing the required folder, but thats more complex than simply right clicking and selecting "Disable Folder"


Thoughts for the future: 

b) perhaps an export & delete operation combined into one  

c) a menu system, a macro set management system, call it what you want.

To take macros out of the main file and into a "Collection" from which we could easily pick and choose, and to which we could remove from current file and into the Collection. The "Collection" would not be part of the main file, but would contain sets, or folders, that could be loaded into the current file, and then removed etc, as required. If someone has say 2000 macros, i dont think they want all that in a single currently loaded file, especially if many of them are only rarely needed. With a "Collection" system, it would also make it convenient to download macros made available by others, and then to retire them to the collection for easy retrieval when needed. Right now we can, though less conveniently, use Windows Explorer to manage macro sets, dragging them in etc. as needed, but removing them is not as simple - have to export and delete. I think this method can be improved upon with a separate Macro management window:  a popup "Collections" window to manage collections, from which we could drag and retrieve macros and  folders, and to which we could retire macros and folders. 


Sorry if i rant, but at least i aint scant. :)
