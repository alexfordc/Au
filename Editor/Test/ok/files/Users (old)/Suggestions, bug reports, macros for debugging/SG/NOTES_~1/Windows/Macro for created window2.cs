 BUG : close "Finished - echo1" works with activated , not created window,


 Update, November 2003: i dont know what the above was for, but i tried it with
 another created window, and same problem, wont work with created window.

 For example, set activation to "!Notepad" or "!Metapad", open a notepad or metapad window:
  the macro wont run
