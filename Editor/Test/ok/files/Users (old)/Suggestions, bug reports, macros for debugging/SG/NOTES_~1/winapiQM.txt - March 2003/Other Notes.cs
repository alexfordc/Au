1) winapi32.txt:

	cbClsextra --> cbClsExtra (2 places)
		eg: type WNDCLASSEX cbSize style lpfnwndproc cbClsextra cbWndExtra2 hInstance hIcon hCursor hbrBackground $lpszMenuName $lpszClassName hIconSm
				-->you have "extra" in one argument but "Extra" in next argument

No i havent checked the whole of winapiQM.txt, but i came across some things like this one and some type declarations.
