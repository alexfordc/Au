Daylight Savings Time
=====================
After Windows 98 put time back one hour on Oct 26 (because of Daylight Savings time)
i was confronted with Qm's message "File has been modified from outside" etc

QM thought the file had been modified, when in fact only the system clock had changed


File modified message after hitting cancel
==========================================
Also: i then hit cancel to that QM message, wanting to save the currently loaded file into a new file 
i did File, Save as. As i was typing in the new filename,
"File has been modified from outside" box suddenly appeared
(only seconds after i had hit cancel that first time) and took my typing of file name for its own input,
and reloaded the file from disk, so i could no longer do the comparison.
I also thus lost some editing i had just done
