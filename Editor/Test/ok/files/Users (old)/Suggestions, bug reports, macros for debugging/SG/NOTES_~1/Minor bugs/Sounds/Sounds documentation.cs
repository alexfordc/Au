Last March, in my confusion, i wrote:

Re:
"·	Sounds – associate sounds with some Quick Macros events (errors, messages, Text-sensitive menus)."
"You can associate sounds with T.S. menu events: Options–>General–>"Sounds ..."."

-->Maybe its my computer thats the problem, but i cant get QM to use any sound
other than the default sound for these. In the Sounds settings, i pick a new
sound, save under a new scheme, but i never hear QM using the sound i picked.

Also, QM wont play ANY sound for T.S. menu events. Am i supposed to select something
for sounds to take effect?

Recently i wrote:

What sounds for what events? Its not clear. I can select a sound but will
that one sound apply to all events or which events? Can i use different sounds
for different events?
OK i figuerd out - need to scroll down to see Quick Macros listed there,
but i never knew that in my 5 years of using windows, and 1 year of using QM 2. lol

To avoid this sort of confusion, you may want to add:

"In Sound Properties, scroll down the Events list for Quick Macros events"
or "Sound Properties is a Windows Control Panel dialog. Scoll down the Events list to [select|find] Quick Macros events."
or 	Sound Properties is a Windows Control Panel dialog:  scroll down the Events list for Quick Macros events.
