 How to cancel beep for key H and key E?
 =======================================
 Here is one of a few macros to "fix" a line of C code 
 It deletes space up to first character, then inserts single tab, and deletes the ; at the end

 Problem: if caret is already at left edge, we get a beep,
 which gets annoying when running the macro a lot

 I solved the problem using key EHCR instead of key HCR, but is
 there  a way to turn off the beep for key E and key H?

key HCR
key SH
key X
key T
key E
key B
key H

		 Position caret right at left egde of line below, then run macro: it beeps
#opt err 1
           if(color == BLACK)
