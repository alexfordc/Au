 Deleting last macro in folder causes jump to top
 ================================================
If i delete macro #n in a folder with n macros, Qm jumps to a point totally 
different(to near the top) then in the left pane

Macro was in a folder within a folder within a folder near the bottom 

But i did the test several times, same result, no matter if folder is top level or a sub-folder
