 Normal copy and paste?
 ======================

---------Skip this part---
Selecting, then dragging editor text to another application (like Metapad), deletes
it from  the editor.

Also, using right-click, copy to copy and paste text, inserts ; and , into pasted text, 
unless using above procedure.

I know this change was needed; however, its not clear to me how to just do a normal 
copy and paste, without inserting of ; and ,

I'm sure others would be wondering too - need to make it clear if or how it can be done.

Update: ok, you HAVE made it clear. I should have looked in help first, where
i found the solution.
BUT it doesnt work. 

If i want to copy text from Qm Editor to Metapad, i cant seem to get the spaces and tabs
in without the ; and ,
