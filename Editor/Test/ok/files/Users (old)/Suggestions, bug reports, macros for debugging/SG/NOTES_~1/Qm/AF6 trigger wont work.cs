out "AF6 pressed"

 Set the trigger for this macro to AF6
 On my computer,  the trigger refuses to work. I have no other macro trigger set to AF6
 I tested it on 2 Win98SE computers, same result

 Before, i had written:  AF6 wont work- it works as if hitting ALT-TAB
 But now, in Qm AF6 just takes focus away from the Qm window, leaving no other window with the focus
 
 I opened up a separate Qm file containing only one other macro, and same result: AF6 wont work
	 but this time it didnt take away focus, it just refused to do anything
