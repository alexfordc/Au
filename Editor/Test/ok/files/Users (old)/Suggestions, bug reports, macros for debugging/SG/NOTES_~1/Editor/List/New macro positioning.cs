 1) Goto a top-level folder, click on a macro inside it
 2) Click on a higher top-level folder (only on the folder, not on a macro this time)
    then choose menu: File, New, New Macro
  	-notice where macro gets created
 3) Repete step 1
 4) Repete step 2, but also click on a sub-folder of that folder before creating a new macro
  	-notice where macro gets created

 Macro in steps 2) and 4) gets created in the folder from step 1),
 which is extremely annoying especially if that folder is far far away from current folder 
 - then i gotta struggle thru back to that folder


 Note: I have the "List: expand single folder" option not checked.
