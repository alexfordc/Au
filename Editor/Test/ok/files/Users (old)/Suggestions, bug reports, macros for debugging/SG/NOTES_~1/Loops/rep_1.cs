rep;
rep 
	 "rep" or "rep;" should give a compile time error, 
	 else when macro or function is run, its 100% processor usage; some people 
	 may not readily spot a lone rep statement in a long macro...
 


 Heres what i wrote in March:
							
 Use of the rep command alone with no statement to be executed: 
 processer usage shoots up,and if stop and run macro again and stop it -
 it no longer stops though the QM tray icon shows it as stopped. But
 system slows down to a crawl....The only way to know 
 that its QM which is then using all the processor power, is to run 
 a utility like procexp (www.sysinternals.com). Well this is a good
 and fast and easy way to make a "virus" lol.
