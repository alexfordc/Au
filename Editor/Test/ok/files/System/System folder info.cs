 The System folder contains QM extensions - functions, classes, declarations, tool dialogs...

 This folder does not contain any macros that you can run directly.
 Don't look here for functions, dialogs, declarations. Instead:
   To find functions, use the 'Find help, functions, tools' field. Or type . (dot) and select from the list.
   Most dialogs are in the floating toolbar, others in menus.
   Simply use Windows API in macros, or type WINAPI. (dot) and select from the list.

 Browsing this folder can be useful only if you want to see code examples to learn programming in QM.
 Don't use private functions from this folder. In function lists they are hidden. You can use their clones.

 This folder is in every QM file that you create or open. Its content is loaded from file System.qml.
 This folder is read-only, it is not possible to edit it in QM, or to delete.
