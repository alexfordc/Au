  If I want to sell this toolbar to people as a stand-alone program,  could I buy licenses for QM and package it with a macro to perform the QM install and configure the toolbar to run on the users computer?  How does the licensing work and what is the pricing for purchasing licenses for this type of scenario?  I only ever used QM for my internal company usage,  this toolbar I am making is the first program that is being used on someone elses computer.  It is a friend of mine that is using the toolbar and he suggested that I try to sell it to other people who work in his industry.  Can you let me know if you have a licensing option that allows for this to be done?  If I can get this to work,  I might be able to sell hundreds of this toolbar program.  If you do not allow this,  I still plan to support and further develop this toolbar for my friends use.  I am not currently using QM for my own business, so I suspect my letting my friend use the toolbar is not violating my license,  if that's not the case please let me know and Ill buy another license.

Am I able to send you a private message regarding this inquiry into the licensing and the possibility of turning my toolbar into a marketable product?  I have several questions that I would like to keep off the forum.  If we can do a private message, can you edit my post and delete all references to this licensing question from my post (if not,  maybe I can edit my post later,  I never tried to do that).

Thanks again for your help
